This is simple Python code written for sole purpose of running a livestream from your machine to your youtube channel.
This code uses an online radio platform as an audio source and a gif which loops as an video background.
You can add any gif or any online radio link as video/audio source.
Just add your youtube stream key and run the script your stream will start in few secs.
You would need ffmpeg and flask for the script, make sure you intall them before.
